# Monocular-Human-Detection-YOLO
This is the readme for Phase 0

Phase 0 of the mid-term involves creating a detailed proposal of the project to be implemented and presenting it to a target audience responsible 
for making critical decisions for the approval of the project.

This GitHub Repo consists of the necessary documents and diagrams associated with this initial proposal.

The Phase0_Initial folder consists of the following:

1. YoloDetector Class UML
2. Detection Class UML
3. ImageProcessor Class UML
4. Utils Class UML
5. Activity Diagram
6. Project Proposal
7. Software Plan
8. Quad Chart

(These are the class diagrams of the classes we are planning to implement. They describe the various functions and attributes present in the classes.)

The QuadChart.pdf file consists of the QuadChart of the project. Again this is available in the Phase0_Initial folder along with the Project Proposal and Software Plan for the Project.
