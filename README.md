# Monocular-Human-Detection-YOLO
This is the readme for Phase 0

Phase 0 of the mid-term involves creating a detailed proposal of the project to be implemented and presenting it to a target audience responsible 
for making critical decisions for the approval of the project.

This GitHub Repo consists of the necessary documents and diagrams associated with this initial proposal.

The Phase0_Initial folder consists of the following:

1. YoloDetector.pdf
2. Detection.pdf
3. ImageProcessor.pdf
4. Utils.pdf

(These are the class diagrams of the classes we are planning to implement. They describe the various functions and attributes present in the classes.)

The QuadChart.pdf file consists of the QuadChart of the project. Again this is available in the Phase0_Initial folder. We have also uploaded a short 
video describing the project.
